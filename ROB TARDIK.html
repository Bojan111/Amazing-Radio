					<p>Rob Tardik is a multi-award winning instrumental based contemporary pop, jazz, Latin, world guitarist. Born and raised in Toronto, Rob began playing the guitar at the age of 7. By 17 he received a high school music scholarship, and then went on to study music at York University in Toronto. Rob also holds diplomas in both Recording Engineering and in Media Arts from Humber College. Thanks to his great talent and hard work Rob received an award at the 2007 Mississauga Established Artist of the Year Award and for the 2010 Canadian Smooth Jazz Guitarist of the Year. He has also released four fantastic CD’s, Without Words, The Right Time, Balance, Energy, Laughter, Love (B.E.L.L.), Limitless, and now he works on his newest album Moments, which should be released in November 2015.</p>
					<p>This amazing musician is currently on the guitar faculty at Metal Works Institute. Rob has been on the guitar faculty of the Merriam School of Music in Oakville for 18 years. The proof of his big heart and generosity is the fact that he organized and hosted his first annual “Out of the Cold” Contemporary Jazz Charity Concert at Carmen’s dinner theatre to a crowd of over 300 guests in February 2011 with the help of Grammy award winners Liberty Silver, Paul Brown and many other talented local musicians with all net profits going to help the families of the fallen Canadian soldiers for the “Canadian Hero Fund”.</p>
					<p>Rob always finds a way to combine his guitar virtuosity and ever tasteful melodic sense to create his signature liquid smooth sound. He doesn’t stop to amaze the Contemporary Jazz scene, with new, creative and original sounds, so stay toоned, you won’t regret it.</p>
