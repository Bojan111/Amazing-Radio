				<h3>Daniel Chia treasures Jazz and brings joy with his music</h3>
				<p>Daniel Chia the saxophonist who is a refreshment for the jazz scene, honored us with a short interview, so we can get to know him better, and understand his love for music. Daniel has released his debut album “In The Moment”, and made a big blast on the jazz scene, and this is only one of the reasons we got curious for this talented musician.</p>
				<p class="bold">What made you fall in love with music at the first place?</p>
				<blockquote>
					<img class="images" src="res/images/Daniel-Chia.jpg" />
					<p>It was when I realised how much joy music could bring people. It transports people to a better place, brings back memories and allows us to share a sense of love and joy.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="bold">There are so many music genres so why jazz?</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>I love Jazz due to the improvisational nature of it. Everytime I play Jazz, its fresh and unique. There are no boundaries to the music and that is what keeps me going.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="bold">Tell us more about your new album “In The Moment”?</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>This album came about from me wanting to just live life to the fullest and pursue what I absolutely wanted. I quit my comfortable job of 4 years to record and release this album and there’s no turning back for me. Life is too short to not to exactly what we want!</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="bold">How did you come to the idea to collaborate with Paul Brown?</p>
				<blockquote>
					<img  class="images" src="res/images/chia.jpg" />
					<p>I had been following his music for a long time. He has also produced for many of my favourite artists like Boney James, Euge Groove, Kirk Whalum, Dave Koz, George Benson and so many others. I knew I wanted to give my all on this album and make it the best one possible. Hence I decided to contact Paul, knowing that he was the best in the industry. He agreed to work with me and within 3 months I was in Los Angeles recording the album.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="bold">What can we expect from you in the near future?</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>My aim is to play as many shows as possible, in as many countries as possible. I just love to share my music and be able to interact with music fans from all walks of life. I am looking forward to recording many albums and share as much music as I can.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="bold">Daniel Chia is a honorable and humble person, he has his principles and life inspiration.</p>
				<blockquote>Be thankful for what I have and treasure everything that is good around me.</blockquote>
