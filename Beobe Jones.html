				<p>Beobe Jones is a big artist coming from a small town in Florida, Clewiston. His talent was noticed when he was only four years old, when he could sing and memorize all the lyrics to songs his father, an airplane pilot, played on the radio. He doesn’t like ordinary things, Jones combined a few types of music, country roots with funk and eventually hip-hop. This inspiration came from the great musicians like Jimi Hendrix, Michael Jackson, and Bo Diddley, who he would eventually get the opportunity to work with. His big break came with working with such artists at Capricorn Records. The label is credited with the birth of Southern Rock in the early 70’s after signing bands like the Allman Brothers and Marshall Tucker.</p>
				<p>In 2014 Beobe released his first Jazz album. Beobe Jones “Reckless” A Jazz Experiment,with 7 tracks, that same year released Country song “Momma” (re-released) and “The Hip Hop Cowboy Anthem” Southern Fried Funky Hip Hop and Rap. He has gone on to be a featured musician with Kid Rock’s band, Mike P and the Dungeon Family, Starship, John Cassidy, Scott Free, Bernie Worrell (P-Funk/Talking Heads), Chris Hicks (Marshall Tucker/Outlaws), Larry G. Hudson, Wayne Mills band, and many more both live and in studio. Currently, he’s working on projects with George Clinton and the P-Funk Family, who he’s collaborated with for more than 15 years.</p>
				<p>Music isn’t the only talent Beobe has. The musician writes, composes, produces, and plays guitar. He first became interested in the guitar when he was young and noticed that all the girls were into guitar players. In addition to music, he has had roles in major films. As a seasoned actor, he has appeared in films such as Trouble with the Curve alongside Clint Eastwood, Identity Thief, Devil’s Knot with Reese Witherspoon, and We Are Marshall with Matthew McConaughey. He has, also, been featured in videos for Trina Braxton’s “Party or Go Home” and Mark Schultz “Everything 2 Me”.</p>
				<p>If you wondered how he can manage to be so multi talented, well, he is a direct descent of Samuel Clemens, better known by his pen name Mark Twain. Author and adventurer Mark Twain had a multifaceted career that included writing literary classics, notably The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885).</p>
				<p>Beobe Jones songs are a rare pearl in the seа. He does not fit in any mold, and he lives a humble life, with his  inspiration and wife Debra and their two dogs.</p>
